# Supervised-Learning
Supervised Learning on various datasets

##Datasets
1. Iris
2. Seeds (Wheat)
3. Boston
4. Handwritten Digits

##How to solve Machine Learning problem

1. Collect lot of data.
2. Decide whether you want Supervised learning or Unsupervised learning.
3. Convert data into samples consisting of features (Feature Extraction).

	3.1 Plot the data to see the distribution of samples.
4. Split the data into training and testing.

	4.1 Determine if features are enough to learn.
	
	4.2 Perform data transformation for faster learning (Data Preprocessing).
	
	4.3 Choose if using unsupervised learning method to reduce the dimensions of data will do good for you.
5. Choose the right model and learning algorithm.
6. Learn using learning algorithm.
7. Measure the performance of the model by cross validating.
8. Test your model using testing data.
9. If possible visualise your model.
