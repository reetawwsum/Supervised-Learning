Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Very small dataset. I'm not sure whether my model will generalise or not. My mind is already running towards Decision Tree as my learning algrithm.
2. Lot of missing data too.
3. Just by looking at the attributes, three out of thirteen attributes are not useful at all, and one is derived attribute.
4. Problem can be defined as both Classification as well as Regression. Predicting feature 1 can be treated as Regression problem, and feature 2 as Classification problem.
5. Lemme visualise first, then I'll decide which path to follow.
6. In order to visualise, I better clean the dataset. Removing unwanted features.
7. Almost, every attribute has missing data.
8. I thought of using attribute 13 as target feature, but due to large number of missing values, I better not use this.
9. Such a messy dataset, even it's bugging numpy array.
10. Removing entry with unknown target.
11. Filling age feature with mean age.
