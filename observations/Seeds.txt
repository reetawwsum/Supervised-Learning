Playing with Seeds(Wheat) dataset
=================================

Seeds dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository
Observations:
By plotting two features at a time, it is observed 90-95 percent of samples are linearly separable.
Thought process:
1. Logistic Regression (One vs All) can give score > 0.90
2. k-nearest neighbor can give score > 0.85
By plotting the dataset in two dimensions after applying PCA, one can see why logistic regression is better classifier for seeds datasets as compared to k-nearest neighbors.
