Note: First feature of sample 446 was different in downloaded dataset. I altered it.
Deductions by plotting the features with respect to price.
1. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town shows inversely proportional relationship with price.
2. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling shows somewhat linear proportional relationship with price.
3. LSTAT - % lower status of the population shows inversely proportional relationship with price.
