Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Difficult to decide which feature to be considered as target value; hence, reading the data file as raw_data, and deciding later.
2. Choosing religion(Attribute 7) of a country as a target value.
3. Taking Attributes(8-30) as features for learning model.
4. Converting color name into numeric value.
