Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Difficult to decide which feature to be considered as target value; hence, reading the data file as raw_data, and deciding later.
2. Choosing religion(Attribute 7) of a country as a target value.
3. Taking Attributes(8-30) as features for learning model.
4. Converting color name into numeric value.
5. Since, dataset is very slow; hence, directly jumping to Decision Trees as my learning model.
6. Getting training score as 99 percent, and testing score as 35 percent. Suffering from High Variance.
7. Train test split results in skew datasets. I need to split the dataset properly.
8. I need to check number of samples in each target class.
9. Distribution of samples in target class
	1: 60 
	0: 40 
	2: 36 
	5: 27 
	6: 15 
	3: 8 
	4: 4 
	7: 4
