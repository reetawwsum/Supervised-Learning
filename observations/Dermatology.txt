Observations & Experimentations
===============================

1. Filling the missing age with average age. That means 2 percent of my data in age feature is unreliable.
2. Distribution of target sample are uneven. Better go with Stratified Shuffle Split.
3. Apart from accuracy score, I have to consider confusion matrix and classification report, since dataset is skew.
4. Using Decision Tree, getting 95-97 percent accuracy on test dataset(10 percent of total dataset)
5. Using Logistic Regression, getting 97.2 percent accuracy on test dataset.
6. Looking at coef of logistic regression model doesn't help.
7. Even with naive bayes, getting accuracy of 97.2 percent. It's getting problem in predicting class 2 and 4.
